## 🔄 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on the [development timeline](docs/TIMELINE.md), the next priorities are:

1. **Price Submission Form**: Allow users to submit new prices
2. **Enhanced Search**: Advanced filtering and product search
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live price updates and notifications
4. **User Profiles**: Enhanced profile management and settings
5. **Supabase Integration**: Replace mock data with real database

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations (by design for Phase 1)
- **Mock Data Only**: All data is stored in localStorage for testing
- **No Real Authentication**: Demo authentication for testing only
- **Limited Admin Features**: Basic admin dashboard placeholder
- **No Image Uploads**: Price submission images not yet implemented
- **No Real-time**: Updates require page refresh

### Technical Debt
- Some custom icons could be replaced with proper icon library
- Form validation could be enhanced
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Loading states could be improved

## 🌍 Internationalization Ready

The application structure supports future internationalization:
- **RTL Support**: Theme configured for Arabic text direction
- **Multi-language**: Data models include Arabic and French translations
- **Font Support**: Arabic fonts configured in theme
- **Cultural Context**: Moroccan market terminology and customs

## 📊 Performance

Current performance characteristics:
- **Fast Development**: Vite hot reloading under 200ms
- **Small Bundle**: Optimized dependencies and code splitting ready
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design with touch-friendly interface
- **Scalable**: Component architecture ready for feature expansion
